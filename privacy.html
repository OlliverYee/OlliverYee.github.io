                        <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> ENTUITIVE may also place cookies on your computer. Cookies are
                            alpha numeric
                            identifiers which are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to
                            enable ENTUITIVE to recognise you whenever you access this website and therefore better
                            personalise your access of the website. A cookie does not identify you personally but it
                            does identify your computer. The help portion of your browser's toolbar should tell you how
                            to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when
                            you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. You should note however that
                            if you do not allow the use of cookies or do not wish to provide certain information to
                            ENTUITIVE you may not be able to take full advantage of this website.</li>
                        <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Although ENTUITIVE may use and publish non-personal aggregate

                            subject to the further terms of this Privacy Policy, ENTUITIVE will not share or make public
                            information about you without your prior permission.</li>

                            can be guaranteed
                            as totally secure. Whilst ENTUITIVE strives to protect such information, we do not warrant
                            and cannot ensure complete security of any information which you transmit to us.
                            Accordingly, any information which you transmit to us is transmitted at your own risk.
                            Nevertheless, once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable steps to preserve
                            the security of such information.</li>

                            information and such information can be readily retrieved. You are also entitled to request
                            ENTUITIVE correct any inaccuracies in any information which ENTUITIVE holds about you.
                            ENTUITIVE is entitled to charge you for the reasonable costs of retrieving, providing this

                            disclose information it
                            holds about you without your prior permission if ENTUITIVE reasonably believes that such

                        <li><strong>Waiver:</strong> If ENTUITIVE waives any rights available to it under this Privacy
                            Policy on one

                        <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of this Privacy Policy is held to be
                            invalid, void,
                            unenforceable or illegal for any reason, such provision shall be deemed to be severed from
                            this Privacy Policy and the remaining provisions shall continue in full force.</li>
