                asbestos management plan shall be developed and used to manage all asbestos materials within a
                workplace, this includes asbestos building products, asbestos in soil and naturally occurring asbestos.

                            <p>Your first action is to identify whether asbestos materials within your building are
                                likely
                                to

                            <p>Failure to do this can result in a fine of $50,000 to your company and $10,000 to
                                individuals.
                            </p>
                            <p>Identifying asbestos in the workplace does not have to be undertaken by a professional
                                consultancy, you can undertake this yourself by using the asbestos survey good practice
                                guidelines developed by Worksafe.</p>
                            <p>The BMIS team do not undertake surveys, however if you require an asbestos survey we
                                recommend
                                that you call ENGEO Ltd on 03 328 9012. ENGEO Ltd has several offices in New Zealand who
                                specialise in environmental testing and can undertake a range of surveys to meet your
                                needs.

                            <p>Alternatively, if you are intending to complete the asbestos survey yourself, BMIS

                            <p>Technically no, this will depend on what ability each PCBU has to influence and control

                                asbestos risks. The more influence and control a PCBU has over an asbestos risk, the
                                more
                                responsibility it is likely to have.</p>
                            <p>As workplace PCBU, you are likely to have more control and influence of risk to your

                                PCBUs should discuss their roles and influences in each situation to come to a
                                resolution
                                for

                            <p>Every PCBU involved must, so far as is reasonably practicable, work together to determine
